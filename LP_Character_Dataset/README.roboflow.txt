Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 936 images.
Number-plate-detection are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 35 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -21 and +21 degrees
* Random shear of between -19째 to +19째 horizontally and -11째 to +11째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
